# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through verification
Accuracy through verification against official tool documentation and best practices

### Clarity for technical audience
Clarity for a technical audience (developers and AI practitioners)

### Reproducibility
Reproducibility (all steps, code, and configurations must be executable and traceable)

### Rigor
Rigor (adhere to Spec-Kit Plus methodologies and Claude Code guidelines)

### Traceability and Citation
All technical claims and instructions must be traceable to sources; Citation format: Markdown links to official docs, GitHub repos, or relevant URLs; Source types: minimum 50% from official tool documentation (e.g., Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code)

### Zero Plagiarism
Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance before deployment; Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 8-10

## Technical Standards and Constraints
Book structure: Multi-chapter Docusaurus site with navigation and search; Tool usage: Mandatory integration of Spec-Kit Plus for specifications and Claude Code for generation; Deployment: GitHub Pages with continuous integration; Length: 10-20 chapters or equivalent sections

## Success Criteria
All processes verified against tool docs; Zero plagiarism detected; Successful deployment to GitHub Pages with no broken links or errors; Passes reproducibility test (e.g., another user can recreate the book from specs)

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation and approval; All work must comply with these principles; Success measured by adherence to accuracy, clarity, reproducibility, and rigor standards
