# Hardware Requirements and Lab Setup

This section outlines the hardware requirements and lab setup needed for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum.

## Recommended Hardware Specifications

### Development Computer
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 or equivalent)
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 3060 or higher recommended)
- **Storage**: 500GB SSD minimum
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended) or other compatible Linux distribution

### Robot Platforms (Optional but Recommended)
- **Humanoid Robot**: Any ROS 2 compatible humanoid robot platform
- **Alternative**: TurtleBot3 or similar mobile manipulator for initial exercises
- **Simulation Only**: Hardware requirements above sufficient for simulation-based learning

## Software Requirements
- **ROS 2**: Humble Hawksbill (LTS) - primary distribution
- **Simulation**: Gazebo Harmonic or Isaac Sim
- **Development Tools**: Git, Python 3.8+, CMake, build-essential
- **Additional Libraries**: As specified in each module

## Lab Setup Recommendations
- Dedicated workspace with power outlets for robot charging
- WiFi network for robot communication
- Safety equipment for robot operation
- Computer stations with dual monitors recommended

## Budget Considerations
- **High-end**: Full humanoid robot platform with development hardware
- **Mid-range**: Mobile manipulator with development hardware
- **Budget**: Simulation-only setup with development hardware
- **Educational**: Shared lab equipment with multiple student access

## Alternative Setup Options
- Cloud-based development environments
- Virtual machines for isolated testing
- Containerized environments for consistency
